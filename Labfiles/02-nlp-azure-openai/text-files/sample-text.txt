Cows, also known as cattle, are one of the most common types of domesticated animals. They belong to the species Bos taurus and are raised primarily for their milk, meat, and hides. Cows have been a part of human civilization for thousands of years, playing a crucial role in agriculture and economy.

Cows are large animals, typically weighing between 600 and 1,000 kilograms. They have a robust body with a large hump over their shoulders, a long tail, and a pair of horns. Their skin is covered with hair that can be of various colors, including white, black, brown, or a mix of these.

Cows are ruminants, which means they have a unique digestive system that allows them to break down tough plant materials. They have a four-chambered stomach, which includes the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. This complex digestive system allows cows to extract maximum nutrients from grass and other plant materials.

Cows are known for their milk production. A single cow can produce an average of 6 to 7 gallons of milk per day. This milk is used to make a variety of dairy products, including cheese, butter, yogurt, and ice cream. The quality and quantity of milk a cow produces depend on its breed, diet, and overall health.
